DDos Attack
-----------

## \[5\]\_Ensemble_Model_DDos_Attack_1-s2.0-S0141933121005585-main.pdf

Voting ensemble model

Employs six base classifiers i.e. two SVMs, two Random Forests, two Gradient Boosted Machines that are differentiated by hyperparameter values

Optimal set of weights are identified by a novel hybrid metaheuristic optimization algorithm (BHO)

Learning phase is important. Detection and mitigation phase is smaller.

Five steps in the algorithm. Uses a combination of two other algorithms.

## \[6\]\_Entropy_SSAE-SVM_DDos_Attack_1-s2.0-S0167404822000037-main.pdf

Detection using an initial module based on information entropy
Then using machine learning with a stacked sparse auto encoder
